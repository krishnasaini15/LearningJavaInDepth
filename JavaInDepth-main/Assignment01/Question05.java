/*5Q. WAP in Java which would contain 8 objects of a Class Employee. Employee contains name, age, department, salary. 
 * Your program would be able to calculate the total salary to be paid in each department.
 *  Use constructors to create these 8 objects and Scanner to take inputs.
		Employee contains name, age, department, salary. Your program would
		be able to calculate the total salary to be paid in each department. Use
		constructors to create these 8 objects and Scanner to take inputs.
		Restrictions:
		1- Minimum 8 objects [can be created manually with parameterized
		constructors with Scanner input]
		2- Departments are, A, B, C, D: minimum 4 departments [String Type]
		3- If the Salary exceeds more than 30,000, then the default salary
		would be 25000 of any of the employee
		4- Use array of objects, instead of using multiple 8 objects separately
		Use:
		Employee arr[] = new Employee[8];
		And
		arr[i].department.equals("A");
